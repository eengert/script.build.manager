# Agent Handoff — synchronized Claude worker

**Status**: Current matrix state is reconciled onto `agent/claude`. Claude is
idle and ready for a future assignment; no new handoff has occurred.

## What was done

- Implemented `tools/antigravity-usage` helper around `/usr/local/bin/codexbar`:
  - Queries `provider = antigravity`, `source = auto`, JSON format, no-color.
  - Parses and preserves named rate windows from `usage.extraRateWindows`
    (e.g., "Gemini weekly" and "Claude/GPT weekly") without collapsing them.
  - Preserves account email, source, login method, and reset descriptions.
  - Calculates remaining percent strictly as `100.0 - usedPercent`.
  - Fails closed with normalized, sanitized unavailable result on error or missing data.
  - Supports `--human` summary output and JSON output.
- Created `tests/test_antigravity_usage.py` covering:
  - Multi-window parsing and distinct Gemini vs. Claude/GPT pool separation.
  - Remaining percentage calculation.
  - Fallback to primary/secondary windows if extraRateWindows is absent.
  - Error handling: malformed JSON, command exit code, missing binary, timeout,
    missing provider record, missing usage section, sanitized error output.
  - All 11/11 tests pass.
- Updated `AGENTS.md` with Antigravity-Specific Notes documenting the authoritative
  command, helper usage, distinct pool preservation, and usage conventions.
- Updated `.agent/USAGE_HISTORY.md` with task convention note and WF-002 row.
- Updated `.agent/AGENT_STATUS.json` and `.agent/CURRENT_TASK.md` for the
  synchronized Claude worker state.

## Validation

- Focused tests: `python3 -m unittest tests/test_antigravity_usage.py` — 11/11 passing.
- Live read-only smoke test: attempted; current CodexBar invocation timed out.
  The helper returned a sanitized unavailable result and exposed no raw stderr
  or private account data.
- `git diff --check`: passed cleanly.
- Real Kodi profile untouched; no Apple TV access; no BM milestone work started.

## Prior BM-018D boundary

- BM-018D remains complete: 17/17 disposable AF3 live checks and 1438/1438
  full tests were previously recorded.
- No production `af3-common` package was created.
- BM-018E, BM-017, BM-019, and BM-020 were not started.
- Real Kodi profile remained read-only; no Apple TV access occurred.

## WF-002 usage record

The Antigravity worker's measured WF-002 usage row is preserved exactly once
in `.agent/USAGE_HISTORY.md`; no Codex usage figures were fabricated.

Current protected matrix: `466d431a3de0dd7b35105ef3c13ca4e0cc0058a7`.

Next step awaits an explicit Agent Handoff or supervisor assignment. BM-018E
is not being worked by Claude.
